# Snap plugin processor - tag

### Installation
#### Download tag plugin binary:
You can get the pre-built binaries for your OS and architecture from the plugin's [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-processor-tag/releases) page. Download the plugin from the latest release and load it into `snapteld` (`/opt/snap/plugins` is the default location for Snap packages).

#### To build the plugin binary:
Fork https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-processor-tag

Clone repo into `$GOPATH/src/github/intelsdi-x/`:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/<yourGithubID>/snap-plugin-processor-tag
```
Build the plugin by running make in repo:
```
$ make
```
This builds the plugin in `./build`

### Configuration and Usage
* Set up the [Snap framework](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap#getting-started)

## Documentation
[Tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_URI_scheme)

### Examples
Example running psutil plugin, tag processor, and writing data into a file.

Documentation for Snap collector psutil plugin can be found [here](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-psutil)

In one terminal window, open the Snap daemon :
```
$ snapteld -t 0 -l 1
```
The option "-l 1" it is for setting the debugging log level and "-t 0" is for disabling plugin signing.

In another terminal window:

Download and load collector, processor and publisher plugins
```
$ wget http://snap.ci.snap-telemetry.io/plugins/snap-plugin-collector-psutil/latest/linux/x86_64/snap-plugin-collector-psutil
$ wget http://snap.ci.snap-telemetry.io/plugins/snap-plugin-processor-tag/latest/linux/x86_64/snap-plugin-processor-tag
$ wget http://snap.ci.snap-telemetry.io/plugins/snap-plugin-publisher-file/latest/linux/x86_64/snap-plugin-publisher-file
$ chmod 755 snap-plugin-*
$ snaptel plugin load snap-plugin-collector-psutil
$ snaptel plugin load snap-plugin-publisher-file
$ snaptel plugin load snap-plugin-processor-tag
```

See available metrics for your system
```
$ snaptel metric list
```

Create a task file. For example, psutil-tag-file.json:
```
{
  "version": 1,
  "schedule": {
    "type": "simple",
    "interval": "1s"
  },
  "workflow": {
    "collect": {
      "metrics": {
        "/intel/psutil/load/load1": {},
        "/intel/psutil/load/load5": {},
        "/intel/psutil/load/load15": {},
        "/intel/psutil/vm/free": {},
        "/intel/psutil/vm/used": {}
      },
      "process": [
        {
          "plugin_name": "tag",
          "config": {
            "tags": "rack1:rack,datacenter:dublin,experiment:1"
          },
          "publish": [
            {
              "plugin_name": "file",
              "config": {
                "file": "/tmp/published_tag.log"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
Start task:
```
$ snaptel task create -t psutil-tag-file.json
Using task manifest to create task

```
snaptel task watch 02dd7ff4-8106-47e9-8b86-70067cd0a850
```

This data is published to a file `/tmp/published_tag.log` per task specification
